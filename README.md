Win Gaming Lounge,

Application Workflow:

	When a user first comes to the page they will be greeted with a visual of what Win Gaming Lounge is about. The main features of our product is the ability to play a variety of new systems and consoles such as the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U and other high end computer systems. Besides playing the latest system we also offer the latest and top Games. Win Gaming Lounge also will be hosting weekly tournaments and seasonal leagues, where Gamers can compete for bragging rights and prizes. The main feature however, is the gratification of being able to play with or against friends and family at one of our many stations.

Our application currently supports Admin users with future support for full users and staff implementation. All you need to do to get started is click the login with Facebook up in the top-right corner and then it will automatically add you to our Firebase database and redirect you to the GTS (Gamer Tracking System) page ,which is essentially the heart of the project. From here you will have full access to all of the admin features such as full CRUD operations for users, games, stations, etc. This will allow an admin to fully customize their workplace and what the Gaming Lounge has to offer. An Admin can also control our GTS, which has 2 basic steps. Add to Queue for any customer who is coming in but isn’t able to play on a specific station at that time, then there is the add to active function which basically takes a gamer out of the queue and allows the admin/staff to specify what station, game, and how much time is allotted to that station for the player. Gamers who are currently logging in will be able to see a basic profile page of their Facebook Profile Image and Name.

From here, our timer controller basically handles all of the functionality of keeping track of all times on all the stations and counting down to 0. When the station hits zero the admin/staff call the next Gamer in Queue to add them to the GTS and so on.

In the future we look forward to expanding our business to include an online gaming league which includes individual user profiles, the users ability to join a "gaming team" essentially to compete in our gaming league with competitions held for certain occasions and basically have access to our own unique network of competitive gaming.
